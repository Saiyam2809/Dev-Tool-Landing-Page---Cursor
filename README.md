# Dev-Tool-Landing-Page---Cursor
Cursor Landing Page – Desktop UI Recreation  This project is a desktop-first recreation of the Cursor developer tool landing page, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this assignment is visual and structural accuracy, closely matching the original Cursor website in layout, typography, spacing, and hierarchy — not creativity or interactivity.
